## General info

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic optimization problem.  <br>
The TSP Solver is designed for academic purposes demonstrating the application of genetic algorithms in solving complex optimization problems. <br>
The code includes functions for loading distance matrices, creating symmetric matrices, and various genetic operations like selection, crossover, and mutation. <br>

## Key Programming Practices

* Modularity: The code is organized into functions for easy readability and maintainability.
* Efficiency: Algorithms are optimized for efficient computation of routes and distances.
* Readability: Consistent naming conventions and code structuring are used for clarity.
* Error Handling: Rrror handling to ensure reliable operation under various input scenarios.
* Documentation: Comprehensive comments to explain the functionality of each part of the code.

## Technologies

* Python 3.11.3
* Visual Studio Code

## Features

* Loading and processing triangular matrix files for distance calculations.
* Symmetric matrix generation for TSP.
* Implementation of genetic algorithm operations: Population initialization, Tournament selection, Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX), Inversion and Exchange mutations
* Elitism strategy to retain top-performing solutions.
* Calculation and display of the optimal route and distance.
* Performance measurement for algorithm execution.

## How to run

* Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
* Place the triangular matrix file in the same directory as the script.
* Run the script in a Python environment.
* The best route and distance will be displayed, along with the execution time.
